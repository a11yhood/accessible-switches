# Other DIY Switches

## Purpose

These switches are designed to be **quick, cost-effective, and simple to build with no expertise**, making them ideal as tester switches for those exploring accessible technology for the first time. While they aren't built for long-term durability, they’re a great way to **try out** switch-based access without a big investment of time or money.

The DIYs we've included are solid examples, but the core idea is that **any two conductive materials (like metal)** can be used to create a working connection. This means there's **a lot of flexibility** in how these switches can be made, depending on the materials and tools you have available. As long as each piece is connected to something like an alligator clip, it’s easy to connect the switch to a device, such as using an audio jack (shown in pictures below).

By making the DIY Hinge switch, we ensured that the usability standards were met, and it did exactly what a button switch would do. We did not have a MakeyMakey, but instead connected it directly to an adapted toy. The switch was easy to use, but there is no need to put a rubber band suggested by the tutorial.

The pencil lead switch worked but shows that it is not a reliable switch. It functioned about half, and the pencil lead had to be very dark on the paper to be able to work. We would recommend marking on the lead as dark as you can so it has a higher chance at connectivity when the two pieces of paper are folded together. This was a super fast switch to make, and definitely one of the cheapest, so it is a good one to try out very quickly.

# Accessible switches

Accessible switches, or adaptive switches, are assistive technology devices that enable individuals with physical or cognitive impairments to interact with various electronic systems. These switches function as alternative input methods, replacing traditional interfaces like keyboards, touchscreens, or small buttons, and can activate actions easier to perform by the user. Users with conditions affecting motor control, including cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, or many others, often rely on these switches to operate devices, thereby enhancing their independence and quality of life.   
Switches offer a different method of activating or controlling different devices, removing the need for fine motor skills, a lot of physical force, or even physical contact, depending on the type of switch. Users can communicate, turn on lights, play with toys, and control household appliances by connecting switches to AAC devices, computers, smart home systems, and assistive devices for mobility. By offering customizable control, switches empower users to engage with the much around them, fostering greater autonomy and improving their quality of life. DIY and commercially available switches expand these options, offering both affordability and flexibility to suit individual needs. 

## Finding accessible switches

Finding the right accessible switch can be difficult and expensive, especially if you don’t even know they exist or aren’t sure where to start. We know that not everyone has the same budget, tools, or technical skills to make one even if they wanted to. Our goal is to spread awareness about accessible switches and provide reliable DIY options for different needs.

Whether you're looking to learn more about switches, find where to buy them, or explore more affordable alternatives, we’ve got you covered. If you need a simple build with household materials, something that requires 3D printing and soldering, or a switch that fits specific mobility needs, we want to make sure there’s an option for you. We’ve researched and tested various switches to help you find what works best for your budget, experience level, and accessibility needs, all in one place.

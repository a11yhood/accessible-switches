![Image of a pressure plate assistive switch with a large, yellow, square surface and a blue, rubberized casing from Enabling Devices. The device is connected to a cable with a plug, positioned for easy use on a flat surface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92248d25-cc24-420b-8e65-6773307a51d8)

## Purpose

The pressure plate is an assistive device designed to activate electronics through applied pressure. This switch enables users with limited motor abilities to interact with their environment more easily by pressing or stepping on the switch. This switch is much thinner and flatter than a button switch.

#### Results From Our Teamâ€™s Recreation

Our team successfully built a working pressure plate switch using this method. The switch was responsive and functioned well. This was able to activate an LED; however, for higher durability, using sturdier materials such as acrylic sheets or 3D-printed parts is recommended. This DIY reduces costs while maintaining functionality, making it an accessible alternative for individuals needing assistive switches on a budget. The size and shape is completely customizable. Below is our DIY pressure plate.

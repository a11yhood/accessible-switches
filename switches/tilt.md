# Tilt Switch

On the left, the sensor is upright with a ball positioned at the top of the sensor, keeping the circuit open (represented by A and B not connected). On the right, when the sensor is tilted, the ball moves and connects the two contacts (A and B), closing the circuit. ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/863d58ef-fd68-46b1-84cd-8ccef3fa6a6d)

## Purpose

Tilt switches are used to detect orientation changes and can serve as an accessible input device for individuals with mobility impairments. They are commonly utilized in assistive technology to enable interaction with electronic devices through simple tilting motions, without pressing or directly clicking contact in another way. This can be especially beneficial if a person has difficulty moving their limbs.

#### Results from our team’s recreation of DIY
To make the DIY easier and cheaper, we used simple materials like a boba straw and regular drinking straw in place of silicone tubing, and assembled the circuit directly on a breadboard without a veroboard. 

![Picture of Tilt Switch prototype on breadboard connected to a power supply via electrical wires](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e36cf2-065e-4e55-9a85-62c3c3355d6f)

We tested two different metal ball sizes (8mm and 6mm) and found that both worked equally well, with performance depending more on the alignment of the pins. Angling the pins outward improved contact reliability, but the connection overall is not as perfect as a button switch for example. Note: The switch only activates on one side where the ball completed the circuit.

We also created a version using cardboard and hot glue, showing that a breadboard isn’t necessary if connections are secure though soldering or carefully placed alligator clips are needed. For durability, replacing cardboard with plastic and housing the switch in a 3D-printed enclosure is recommended. Overall, the tilt switch worked pretty effectively with minimal components and provided a low-cost, customizable alternative.

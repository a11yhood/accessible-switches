## DIYs

### DIY1: Proximity Switch Design

#### Important Note:

While the DIY proximity switch demonstrates how to use sensor components like the VL53L0X or an ultrasonic module, it is not a complete equivalent to a commercially available proximity switch designed for assistive technology use. These tutorials show how to build electronic components as a sensor but not how to convert it into a working proximity switch that can work for accessible devices..

This switch can be built using off-the-shelf components. Some available DIY resources:

* VL53L0X Distance Sensor Guide – [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3317)  
* Ultrasonic Sensor DIY Tutorial – [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24045)

#### Expertise Required: 

* Some Arduino Programming Experience Preferred  
* General electronics building experience  
* These DIY’s are approachable with some practice and perfect for learners looking to get hands-on experience.

#### Results from our team’s recreation of DIY

By making the DIY Hinge switch, we resulted that the usability standards were met, and it did exactly what a button switch would do. It was also relatively cheap to make the price of materials. In testing the switch, we reached the conclusion that it was easy to use and there is no need to put a rubber band suggested by the [makey makey](https://www.youtube.c/) tutorial on DIY switches.

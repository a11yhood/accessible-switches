# Accessible Switches

**What is an Accessible Switch?**

Accessible switches, or adaptive switches, are assistive technology devices that enable [individuals with physical, cognitive, or movement-limiting impairments](https://enablingdevices.com/blog/different-types-of-adaptive-switches-for-individuals-with-disabilities/?srsltid=AfmBOoqzCfrFkNcwPgqxNL_NqOHPGh31QFYt1AkFsaKXI1vAx6VE6vXw) to interact with various electronic systems. These switches function as alternative input methods, replacing traditional interfaces like keyboards, touchscreens, or small buttons, and [can activate actions easier to perform by the user](https://ialabs.ie/adaptive-switches-and-how-they-help-people-with-disabilities/#:~:text=Adaptive%20switch%20devices%20are%20a,Operating%20a%20wheelchair). Users with conditions [affecting motor control](https://webaim.org/articles/motor/motordisabilities), including cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, or many others, often rely on accessible devices, such as switches, to operate many things, thereby enhancing their independence and quality of life.

**How Switches Empower Users**  
Switches offer a different method of activating or controlling different devices, by removing the need for fine motor skills, a lot of physical force, or even physical contact, depending on the type of switch. Users can do various different things easier with the help of switches, some examples include:

* Communicate  
* Play with toys  
* Turn on lights / use smart-home systems  
* Control household appliances  
* Use AAC devices  
* Use computers & tablets  
* Control assistive devices for mobility  
* And many more\!

By offering customizable control, switches empower users to engage with the devices around them, fostering greater autonomy and improving their quality of life. DIY and commercially available switches expand these options, offering both affordability and flexibility to suit individual needs.

## Our Goal

**Providing Reliable Switch Options**  
Finding the right accessible switch can be difficult and expensive, especially if you don’t even know they exist or aren’t sure where to start. We know that not everyone has the same budget, tools, or technical skills to make one, even if they wanted to. Our goal is to **spread awareness** about accessible switches and **provide reliable switches** along with DIY options for different needs.

Whether you're looking to learn more about switches, find where to buy them, or explore more affordable alternatives, we’ve got you covered. If you need a simple build with household materials, something that requires 3D printing and soldering, or a switch that fits specific mobility needs, we want to make sure there’s an option for you. We’ve researched and tested various switches to help you find what works best for your budget, experience level, and accessibility needs, all in one place.

## Background Information on Connecting Switches

Most accessible switches are **activation switches** — when you press them, they send a signal that triggers a single action, like turning something on or starting a sound. They **don’t control a device** completely (like turning it off and on or changing settings); they simply act like a basic button press.

**Using Audio Jacks for DIY Switches**  
Most of the DIY switches on our website are **designed to connect using standard audio jacks** (3.5mm)\*, which are commonly used in **adapted toys**. Adapted toys are modified so that pressing the switch performs the same action as the original button on the toy — for example, making the toy move or make a sound. The switch basically acts as a duplicate button in a more accessible location.

\***Note**: Any connection cord can be used, audio jacks, USB A, C, mini, etc. We use audio jacks as they are super common and easy to connect.

**Why Switches Don’t Work Directly with Tablets or Computers**  
However, if you plug one of these switches **directly into a regular tablet, iPad, or computer**, **nothing will happen**. That’s because tablets don’t automatically recognize or respond to a basic switch press. To make a switch work with a device like an iPad, you’ll need a **switch interface** — a tool that acts as a middleman between the switch and the device, translating a switch press into an action the device understands (like a screen tap or keyboard input).

**Commercial Basic Switch Interfaces for Devices**  
There are many tutorials online for how to set up switches with devices using different types of interfaces. One lower-cost example is the [**MakeyMakey**](https://makeymakey.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoolU5lBew_3lsnoGix1qg2osxmcw2p60T_b4pKg26lGRFjDTS9h), which is pre-programmed to work with computers and can be used as a **basic switch interface for DIY switches**.  
Some commercially available switch interfaces are: 

* [Hook+ Switch Interface](https://www.infogrip.com/hook-switch-interface.html)  
* [Hitch 2](https://www.ablenetinc.com/hitch-2/)  
* [Microsoft Adaptive Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-adaptive-hub/8pbjx6zn089b?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Keep in mind that most of the DIYs we include on this site only show how to make the switch itself, not how to connect it to a device. So when building one, you may need an additional tool — like an interface — depending on what you want to use it for.

**Adaptive Gaming**  
Adaptive Gaming switches are also very popular as they are already made to connect directly to device or gaming console, and no switch interface is needed. These switches can be quite expensive though as they are solely made for their specific console.

## Before You Start DIYing

Note that all DIYs should be built with care, especially if you’re using power tools, soldering irons, hot glue guns etc. **Safety is essential\!** Always wear proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) to protect yourself from injury. PPE may include:

* Safety glasses to protect your eyes  
* Gloves to guard against cuts, burns, or exposure to chemicals  
* Proper Ventilation when soldering or using adhesive materials

Always choose and use PPE based on the task you’re doing. Build DIYs based on your own comfort and experience level, and if you’re unsure how to use a tool or perform a step, ask for help or look up a trusted tutorial before continuing.

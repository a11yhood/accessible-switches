## Purpose

Tilt switches are used to detect orientation changes and can serve as an accessible input device for individuals with mobility impairments. They are commonly utilized in assistive technology to enable interaction with electronic devices through simple tilting motions, without pressing or directly clicking contact in another way. This can be especially beneficial if a person has difficulty moving their limbs.

# Sip and Puff Switch

## Purpose

Sip and Puff switches are switches that help users activate devices through the action of sipping and puffing air through a tube. This switch is commonly used for individuals who have limited or no use of their upper extremities to control devices, using only their mouth to activate the switch.

#### Results from Our Team’s Recreation of DIY (Science Buddies) 

The DIY Puff switch was easy to replicate, and since it did not   
require prior technical expertise or high-tech materials, it shows that this alternative is  
affordable and easy to create, especially for those with little to no experience. Although the material used in the following figure is not of the highest quality, if made with care and with more sturdy material, the switch can last a good while if the straw is replaced to maintain proper sanitation protocols. In our attempt, we saw that it can be built without the use of a straw. No straw requires a stronger blow, as it is not focused, but might be a little easier for some users. We recommend paying attention to where you position your straw and blow, as having it too close to the base of the attached aluminum will not cause it to move enough. The longer the piece of aluminum is, the more flexible and easy it is to blow and contact the other side, causing a connection.

We connected the switch to a circuit board with an LED to test it, but you can connect the alligator clips to headphone jack wires, for example, and therefore be able to connect this switch to a device or adapted toy. (We speak more about this DIY connection process in the Other DIY Switches section of the website.)

Below, shows our sip and puff prototype.

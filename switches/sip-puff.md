The DIY Sip and Puff switch (Finio, 2024) was easy to replicate, and since it did not 
require prior technical expertise or high-tech materials, it shows that this alternative is
affordable and easy to create, especially for those with little to no experience. Although the 
the material used in the following figure is not of the highest quality, if made with care and with more sturdy material, the switch can last a good while if the straw is replaced to maintain proper sanitation protocols.

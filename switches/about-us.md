You may be wondering what is HuskyADAPT? HuskyADAPT is a student organization at the University of Washington, Seattle, that works on making more accessible design and inclusivity in technology. Within this organization, Design Teams work on a project year-round dedicated to research, design, prototype, and test a specific design problem from community members.  

We are a group of six undergraduate students forming a multidisciplinary team focused on building an informational website about accessible switches, including cheaper alternatives to buying a switch. The switches we build during testing will be provided to our partner, ODMF. ODMF is helping us create a platform we know will be helpful for the community. We are also working with with a few accessibility experts from CREATE.

ODMF is the community member that we are working with to help build more affordable switches for minority kids in Washington schools who have disabilities. With the provided information that we present on building switches and affordable DIY switches, ODMF can support more families and hopefully create a better learning environment for children.

CREATE is the center for research and technology in the University of Washington in also striving to make technology be more accessible for people who have disabilities. CREATE works alongside with HuskyADAPT to help as an extra resource for projects. We've worked with CREATE to provide more feedback on our work on building switches and also a lot of feedback on building the website to be able to meet the needs of families while using it to learn more about switches.
